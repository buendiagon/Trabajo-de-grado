    abstract   = {Today’s Internet of Things (IoT) applications are mostly developed as a bundle of hardware and associated software. Future cross-manufacturer app stores for IoT applications will require that the strong coupling of hardware and software is loosened. In the resulting IoT applications, a quintessential challenge is the effective and efficient deployment of IoT software components across variable networks of heterogeneous devices. Current research focuses on computing whether deployment requirements fit the intended target devices instead of assisting users in successfully deploying IoT applications by suggesting deployment requirement relaxations or hardware alternatives. This can make successfully deploying large-scale IoT applications a costly trial-and-error endeavor. To mitigate this, we have devised a method for providing such deployment suggestions based on search and backtracking. This can make deploying IoT applications more effective and more efficient, which, ultimately, eases reducing the complexity of deploying the software surrounding us.},

We investigate how the inherent encapsulation of component and connector (C&C) architectures can be used to develop and deploy reliable IoT applications. Existing C&C languages for the development of IoT applications mainly focus on the description of architectures and the distribution of components to IoT devices. Furthermore, related approaches often pollute the models with low-level implementation details, tying the models to a particular platform and making them harder to understand. In this paper, we introduce MontiThings, a C&C language offering automatic error handling capabilities and a clear separation between business logic and implementation details. The error-handling methods presented in this paper can make C&C-based IoT applications more reliable without cluttering the business logic with error-handling code that is time-consuming to develop and makes the models hard to understand, especially for non-experts.}

Fog is characterized by low latency with a wider spread and geographically distributed nodes to support mobility, real-time interaction, and location-based services. To provide optimum quality of user life in modern buildings, we rely on a holistic Framework, designed in a way that decreases latency and improves energy saving and services efficiency with different capabilities. Discrete EVent system Specification (DEVS) is a formalism used to describe simulation models in a modular way. In this work, the sub-models of connected objects in the building are accurately and independently designed, and after installing them together, we easily get an integrated model which is subject to the fog computing Framework. Simulation results show that this new approach significantly, improves energy efficiency of buildings and reduces latency. Additionally, with DEVS, we can easily add or remove sub-models to or from the overall model, allowing us to continually improve our designs.},

    abstract  = {This book provides students with a deep, working understanding of the essential concepts of programming languages. Most of these essentials relate to the semantics, or meaning, of program elements, and the text uses interpreters (short programs that directly analyze an abstract representation of the program text) to express the semantics of many essential language elements in a way that is both clear and executable. The approach is both analytical and hands-on. The book provides views of programming languages using widely varying levels of abstraction, maintaining a clear connection between the high-level and low-level views. Exercises are a vital part of the text and are scattered throughout; the text explains the key concepts, and the exercises explore alternative designs and other issues. The complete Scheme code for all the interpreters and analyzers in the book can be found online through The MIT Press Web site. For this new edition, each chapter has been revised and many new exercises have been added. Significant additions have been made to the text, including completely new chapters on modules and continuation-passing style. Essentials of Programming Languages can be used for both graduate and undergraduate courses, and for continuing education courses for programmers.}

    abstract = {Semantic knowledge representations in the IoT can enable the vision of autonomic computing by providing a specification that enables interoperability and reasoning. Nevertheless, semantic representations in IoT have focused on describing the elements that compose it and their interactions, without addressing the challenges of the logical evolution of a system (updating and design of new algorithms). This work focuses on this gap, proposing the Taxonomy for Decision Making in IoT Systems (TDMIoT), a high-level characterization of decision-making processes in IoT developed following a conceptual-empirical methodological approach. TDMIoT considers a decision-making process a problem-solution association aiming to deliver a semantic representation that can be used as a design framework to support changes or even the design of new decision processes. A systematic review of the literature on decision-making processes in IoT application domains was conducted to evaluate the taxonomy as a classification scheme. A summary of the state-of-the-art decision-making process design approaches was generated from the classification of the selected studies through the systematic review. The classification showed design bias regarding the decision processes. For instance, most studies have focused on decision processes with prediction as an objective, and the most widely used algorithmic approach has been data-driven. In addition, the taxonomy was used to develop the COVID-19 Crowd Management project to test its usefulness as a design framework. In this regard, TDMIoT narrowed the search for decision models, validating its effectiveness in selecting an algorithmic approach for a given objective.}
